					<span>I ust to read in the novel books ’bout fellers that got the prod</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From an arrer shot from his hidin’ place by the hand o’ the Cupid god,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ I’d laugh at the cussed chumps they was a-wastin’ their breath in sighs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ goin’ around with a locoed look a-campin’ inside their eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve read o’ the gals that broke ’em up a-sailin’ in airy flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On angel pinions above their beds as they dreampt o’ the same at night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ a sort o’ disgusted frown’d bunch the wrinkles acrost my brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ I’d call ’em a lot o’ sissy boys⁠—but I’m seein’ it different now.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I got the jab in my rough ol’ heart, an’ I got it a-plenty, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A center shot from a pair o’ eyes of the winninest sort o’ blue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ I ride the ranges a-sighin’ sighs, as cranky as a locoed steer⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A durned heap worse than the novel blokes that the narrative gals’d queer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just hain’t no energy left no mo’, go ’round like a orphant calf</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A-thinkin’ about that sagehen’s eyes that give me the Cupid gaff,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ I’m all skeered up when I hit the thought some other rider might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cut in ahead on a faster hoss an’ rope her afore my sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There ain’t a heifer that ever run in the feminine beauty herd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could switch a tail on the whole durned range ’long-side o’ that little bird;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A figger plump as a prairy dog’s that’s feedin’ on new spring grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ as purty a face as was ever flashed in front of a lookin’ glass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’s got a smile that ’d raise the steam in the icyist sort o’ heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A couple o’ soul inspirin’ eyes, an’ the nose that keeps ’em apart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is the cutest thing in the sassy line that ever occurred to act</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a ornament stuck on a purty face, an’ that’s a dead open fact.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’m a-goin’ to brace her by an’ by to see if there’s any hope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see if she’s liable to shy when I’m ready to pitch the rope;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see if she’s goin’ to make a stand, or fly like a skeered up dove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I make a pass with the brandin’ iron that’s het in the fire o’ love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll open the little home corral an’ give her the level hunch</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make a run fur the open gate when I cut her out o’ the bunch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fur there ain’t no sense in a-jammin’ round with a heart that’s as soft as dough</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ a-throwin’ the breath o’ life away bunched up into sighs. Heigh-ho!</span>

					<span>Too abundant till I’d got</span>

					<span>As we walked along that night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He got talkin’ of the bright</span>

					<span>Somehow felt, I dunno why,</span>

					<span>That a-fore we cake-walked back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the ranch he’d make a crack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fer my hand, and I was plum</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Achin’ fer the shock to come.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>By and by he says, “I’ve got</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fifty head o’ cows, and not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of ’em but, on the dead,</span>
					<br/>

				<p>
					<span>“Bin a-lookin’ round,” says he,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>If I should pitch the poppin’ rope.</span>
					<br/>

					<span>’Twas a girl I learnt it from</span>

					<span class="i1">Livin’ down Sonora way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I don’t look much like a lover,</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">Often, when I’m all alone⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="es">Mi amor, mi corazón.</i>”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nights when she knew where I’d ride</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Throw the big door open wide,</span>

					<span>That beats hers to a fare-you-well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fer, on the square, I’m here to tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I jes can’t even start to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what she’s perfect as kin be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fer any fault I finds excuse⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll tell you, pard, it hain’t no use</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fer me to try to raise a hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When on my heart she’s run her brand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The bunk-house ain’t the same to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bunch jes makes me weary⁠—Gee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never knew they was so coarse⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I warps my face to try to force</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A smile at each old gag they spring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fer I’d heap ruther hear her sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sweet Adeline,” or softly play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The “Dream o’ Heaven” that-a-way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Besides this place, most anywhere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d ruther be⁠—so she was there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She called me “dear,” an’ do you know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My heart jes skipped a beat, an’ though</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’m hard to feaze, I’m free to yip</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My reason nearly lost its grip.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She called me “dear,” jes sweet an’ slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ lookin’ down an’ speakin’ low;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ if I had ten lives to live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With everything the world could give,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d shake ’em all without one fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If ’fore I’d go she’d call me “dear.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You wonders why I slicks up so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Sundays, when I gits to go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see her⁠—well, I’m free to say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’s like religion that-a-way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jes sort o’ like some holy thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As clean as young grass in the spring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ so before I rides to her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I looks my best from hat to spur⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But even then I hain’t no right</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To think I look good in her sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If she should pass me up⁠—say, boy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You jes put hobbles on your joy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First thing you know, you gits so gay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your luck stampedes and gits away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ don’t you even start a guess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you’ve a cinch on happiness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fer few e’er reach the Promised Land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If they starts headed by a band.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ride slow an’ quiet, humble, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or Fate will slap its brand on you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The old range sleeps, there hain’t a stir.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less it’s a night-hawk’s sudden whir,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or cottonwoods a-whisperin while</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The red moon smiles a lovin’ smile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ there I set an’ hold her hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So glad I jes can’t understand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The reason of it all, or see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why all the world looks good to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or why I sees in it heap more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of beauty than I seen before.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fool talk, perhaps, but it jes seems</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’re ridin’ through a range o’ dreams;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where medder larks the year round sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ it’s jes one eternal spring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ time⁠—why time is gone⁠—by gee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s no such thing as time to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until she says, “Here, boy, you know</span>

					<span>I’ve heard that story ofttimes about that little chap</span>

					<span>A-cryin’ for the shiney moon to fall into his lap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ jes a-raisin’ merry hell because he couldn’t git</span>

					<br/>
					<span>A-goin’ round with achin’ eyes a-hankerin’ fer a peach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s hangin’ on the beauty tree, too high fer me to reach.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’m jes a rider of the range, plumb rough an’ on-refined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ wild an’ keerless in my ways, like others of my kind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A reckless cuss in leather chaps, an’ tanned an’ blackened so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’d think I wuz a Greaser from the plains of Mexico.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never learnt to say a prayer, an’ guess my style o’ talk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If fired off in a Sunday School would give ’em all a shock;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ yet I got a-mopin’ round as crazy as a loon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ actin’ like the story kid that bellered fer the moon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I wish to God she’d never come with them bright laughin’ eyes⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had never flashed that smile that seems a sunburst from the skies⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had stayed there in her city home instead o’ comin’ here</span>

					<span>To visit at the ranch an’ knock my heart plumb out o’ gear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wish to God she’d talk to me in a way to fit the case⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In words t’d have a tendency to hold me in my place⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Instead o’ bein’ sociable an’ actin’ like she thought</span>

				<p>
					<span>If I would hint to her o’ love, she’d hit that love a jar</span>

					<span>An’ laugh at sich a tough as me a-tryin’ to rope a star;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’d give them fluffy skirts a flirt, an’ skate out o’ my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ leave me paralyzed⁠—an’ it’d serve me cussed right.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wish she’d pack her pile o’ trunks an’ hit the city track,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ maybe I’d recover from this violent attack;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ in the future know enough to watch my feedin’ ground</span>

					<span>Well balanced, well rounded, a power for right;</span>

				<p>
					<span>Your voice is a bellicose bark of ill-will,</span>

					<span>That time when Bob got throwed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought I sure would bust.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I like to died a-laffin’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see him chewin’ dust.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He crawled on that Andy bronc</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hit him with a quirt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The next thing that he knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was wallowin’ in the dirt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, it might a-killed him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard the old ground pop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to see if he was injured</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You bet I didn’t stop.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I just rolled on the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And began to kick and yell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It like to tickled me to death</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see how hard he fell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twarn’t more than a week ago</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I myself got throwed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(But ’twas from a meaner horse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than old Bob ever rode).</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>D’you reckon Bob looked sad and said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I hope that you ain’t hurt!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Naw! He just laffed and laffed and laffed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see me chewin’ dirt.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’ve been prayin’ ever since</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his horse to turn his pack;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he done it, I’d a laffed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it had broke his back.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So I was still a-howlin’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Bob, he got up lame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He seen his horse had run clean off</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so for me he came.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He first chucked sand into my eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a rock he rubbed my head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he twisted both my arms⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now go fetch that horse,” he said.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So I went and fetched him back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I was feelin’ good all day;</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">When You’re Throwed</h3>
				<p>
					<span>If a feller’s been a-straddle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since he’s big enough to ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And has had to sling his saddle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On most any colored hide⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though it’s nothin’ they take pride in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still most fellers I have knowed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If they ever done much ridin’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has at different times got throwed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All the boys start out together</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the round-up some fine day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When you’re due to throw your leather</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On a little wall-eyed bay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ he swells to beat the nation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When you’re cinchin’ up the slack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ he keeps an elevation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In your saddle at the back.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He stands still with feet a-sprawlin’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ his eye shows lots of white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ he kinks his spinal column,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ his hide is puckered tight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He starts risin’ an’ a-jumpin’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ he strikes when you get near,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ you cuss him an’ you thump him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till you get him by the ear⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then your right hand grabs the saddle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ you ketch your stirrup, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ you try to light a-straddle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a woolly buckaroo;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he drops his head an’ switches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he makes a backward jump,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of reach your stirrup twitches</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But your right spur grabs his hump.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>An’ “Stay with him!” shouts some feller;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though you know it’s hope forlorn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet you’ll show that you ain’t yeller</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ you choke the saddle horn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then you feel one rein a-droppin’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ you know he’s got his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ your shirt tail’s out an’ floppin’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ the saddle pulls like lead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then the boys all yell together</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fit to make a feller sick:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hey, you short horn, drop the leather!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fan his fat an’ ride him slick!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seems you’re up-side-down an’ flyin’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then your spurs begin to slip.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s no further use in tryin’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the horn flies from your grip,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>An’ you feel a vague sensation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As upon the ground you roll,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a violent separation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt your body an’ your soul.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then you roll agin a hummock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where you lay an’ gasp for breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ there’s somethin’ grips your stomach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like the finger-grips o’ death.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They all offers you prescriptions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the grip an’ for the croup,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ they give you plain descriptions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How you looped the spiral loop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all swear you beat a circus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or a hoochy-koochy dance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moppin’ up the canon’s surface</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the bosom of your pants.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then you’ll get up on your trotters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But you have a job to stand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the landscape round you totters</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ your collar’s full o’ sand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lots of fellers give prescriptions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How a broncho should be rode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there’s few that gives descriptions</span>
					<br/>

					<span>And only living broncho</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That your servant couldn’t burst.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was a no-count buckskin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wasn’t worth two-bits to keep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had a black stripe down his backbone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was woolly like a sheep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hoss wasn’t built to tread the earth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He took natural to the air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every time he went aloft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He tried to leave me there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>

					<span>Lights from Jerusalem shone.</span>

					<span class="i1">But the night is brimmin’ music and its glory is complete</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Cowboy’s Dance Song</h3>
				<p>
					<span>You can’t expect a cowboy to agitate his shanks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In etiquettish manner in aristocratic ranks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he’s always been accustomed to shake the heel and toe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the rattling rancher dances where much etiquet don’t go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You can bet I set them laughing in quite an excited way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A-giving of their squinters an astonished sort of play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I happened into Denver and was asked to take a prance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the smooth and easy mazes of a high-toned dance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When I got among the ladies in their frocks of fleecy white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the dudes togged out in wrappings that were simply out of sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell you what, I was embarrassed, and somehow I couldn’t keep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From feeling like a burro in a pretty flock of sheep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every step I made was awkward and I blushed a fiery red</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like the principal adornment of a turkey gobbler’s head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ladies said ’twas seldom that they had had the chance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see an old-time puncher at a high-toned dance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I cut me out a heifer from a bunch of pretty girls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yanked her to the center to dance the dreamy whirls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She laid her head upon my bosom in a loving sort of way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we drifted into heaven as the band began to play.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I could feel my neck a-burning from her nose’s breathing heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she do‑ce‑doed around me, half the time upon my feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She peered up in my blinkers with a soul-dissolving glance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quite conducive to the pleasures of a high-toned dance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Every nerve just got a-dancing to the music of delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I hugged the little sagehen uncomfortably tight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she never made a bellow and the glances of her eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed to thank me for the pleasure of a genuine surprise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She snuggled up against me in a loving sort of way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I hugged her all the tighter for her trustifying play⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell you what the joys of heaven ain’t a cussed circumstance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the hug-a-mania pleasures of a high-toned dance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When they struck the old cotillion on the music bill of fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every bit of devil in me seemed to burst out on a tear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I fetched a cowboy whoop and started in to rag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cut her with my trotters till the floor began to sag;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swung my pardner till she got sea-sick and rushed for a seat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I balanced to the next one but she dodged me slick and neat.⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell you what, I shook the creases from my go-to-meeting pants</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I put the cowboy trimmings on that high-toned dance.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Cowboys’ Christmas Ball</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Way out in Western Texas, where the Clear Fork’s waters flow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the cattle are “a-browzin’ ” and the Spanish ponies grow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the Norther “comes a-whistlin’ ” from beyond the Neutral strip</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the prairie dogs are sneezin’, as if they had “the Grip”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the coyotes come a-howlin’ round the ranches after dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the mocking-birds are singin’ to the lovely “medder lark”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the possum and the badger, and rattle-snakes abound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the monstrous stars are winkin’ o’er a wilderness profound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where lonesome, tawny prairies melt into airy streams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the Double Mountains slumber in heavenly kinds of dreams;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the antelope is grazin’ and the lonely plovers call⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was there that I attended “The Cowboys’ Christmas Ball.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The town was Anson City, old Jones’s county seat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where they raise Polled Angus cattle, and waving whiskered wheat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the air is soft and “bammy,” an’ dry an’ full of health,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the prairies is explodin’ with agricultural wealth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where they print the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Texas Western</i>, that <abbr>Hec.</abbr> McCann supplies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With news and yarns and stories, of most amazin’ size;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where Frank Smith “pulls the badger,” on knowin’ tender feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Democracy’s triumphant, and mighty hard to beat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where lives that good old hunter, John Milsap from Lamar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who “used to be the sheriff, back East, in Paris, sah!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas there, I say, at Anson, with the lively “Widder Wall,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I went to that reception, “The Cowboys’ Christmas Ball.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The boys had left the ranches and come to town in piles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ladies⁠—“kinder scatterin’ ”⁠—had gathered in for miles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet the place was crowded, as I remember well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas got for the occasion at “The Morning Star Hotel.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The music was a fiddle and a lively tambourine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a “viol come imported,” by stage from Abilene.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The room was togged out gorgeous⁠—with mistletoe and shawls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And candles flickered frescoes around the airy walls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The “wimmin folks” looked lovely⁠—the boys looked kinder treed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till their leader commenced yellin’: “Whoa, fellers, let’s stampede.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The music started sighin’ and a-wailin’ through the hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a kind of introduction to “The Cowboys’ Christmas Ball.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The leader was a fellow that came from Swenson’s Ranch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They called him “Windy Billy,” from “little Dead-man’s Branch.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His rig was “kinder keerless,” big spurs and high-heeled boots;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had the reputation that comes when “fellers shoots.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His voice was like the bugle upon the mountain’s height;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His feet were animated, an’ a <em>mighty movin’ sight</em>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he commenced to holler, “Neow, fellers, stake yer pen!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lock horns to all them heifers, an’ russle ’em like men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saloot yer lovely critters; neow swing an’ let ’em go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Climb the grape vine round ’em⁠—all hands do‑ce‑do!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You Mavericks, jine the round-up⁠—Jest skip her waterfall,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Huh! hit wuz gittin’ happy, “The Cowboys’ Christmas Ball!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The boys were tolerable skittish, the ladies powerful neat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That old bass viol’s music <em>just got there with both feet</em>.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That wailin’ frisky fiddle, I never shall forget;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Windy kept a singin’⁠—I think I hear him yet⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Xes, chase your squirrels, an’ cut ’em to one side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spur Treadwell to the center, with Cross <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">P.</abbr> Charley’s bride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doc. Hollis down the middle, an’ twine the ladies’ chain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Varn Andrews pen the fillies in big <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Diamond’s train.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All pull yer freight tergether, neow swallow fork an’ change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Big Boston’ lead the trail herd, through little Pitchfork’s range.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Purr round yer gentle pussies, neow rope ’em! Balance all!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Huh! hit wuz gittin’ active⁠—“The Cowboys’ Christmas Ball!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The dust riz fast an’ furious, we all just galloped round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till the scenery got so giddy, that Z Bar Dick was downed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We buckled to our partners, an’ told ’em to hold on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shook our hoofs like lightning until the early dawn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Don’t tell me ’bout cotillions, or germans. No sir ’ee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That whirl at Anson City just takes the cake with me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’m sick of lazy shufflin’s, of them I’ve had my fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give me a fronteer breakdown, backed up by Windy Bill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>McAllister ain’t nowhere! when Windy leads the show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve seen ’em both in harness, an’ so I sorter know⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh, Bill, I shan’t forget yer, and I’ll oftentimes recall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lively-gaited sworray⁠—“The Cowboys’ Christmas Ball.”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">A Dance at the Ranch</h3>
				<p>
					<span>From every point they gaily come, the broncho’s unshod feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pat at the green sod of the range with quick, emphatic beat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tresses of the buxom girls as banners stream behind⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like silken, castigating whips cut at the sweeping wind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dashing cowboys, brown of face, sit in their saddle thrones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sing the wild songs of the range in free, uncultured tones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or ride beside the pretty girls, like gallant cavaliers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pour the usual fairy tales into their list’ning ears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the “best room” of the ranch the jolly gathered throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Buzz like a hive of human bees and lade the air with song;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The maidens tap their sweetest smiles and give their tongues full rein</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In efforts to entrap the boys in admiration’s chain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fiddler tunes the strings with pick of thumb and scrape of bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Finds one string keyed a note too high, another one too low;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then rosins up the tight-drawn hairs, the young folks in a fret</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until their ears are greeted with the warning words, “All set!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">S’lute yer pardners! Let ’er go!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Balance all an’ do‑ce‑do!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Swing yer girls an’ run away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right an’ left an’ gents sashay!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gents to right an’ swing or cheat!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On to next gal an’ repeat!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Balance next an’ don’t be shy!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Swing yer pard an’ swing ’er high!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bunch the gals an’ circle round!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whack yer feet until they bound!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Form a basket! Break away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Swing an’ kiss an’ all git gay!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Al’man left an’ balance all!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lift yer hoofs an’ let ’em fall!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Swing yer op’sites! Swing agin!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kiss the sagehens if you kin!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ thus the merry dance went on till morning’s struggling light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In lengthening streaks of grey breaks down the barriers of the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And broncs are mounted in the glow of early morning skies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By weary-limbed young revelers with drooping, sleepy eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cowboys to the ranges speed to “work” the lowing herds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The girls within their chambers hide their sleep like weary birds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for a week the young folks talk of what a jolly spree</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had that night at Jackson’s ranch down on the Owyhee.</span>
