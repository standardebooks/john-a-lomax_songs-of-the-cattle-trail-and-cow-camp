				<h3 epub:type="title">The Cowboy</h3>
				<p>
					<span>He wears a big hat and big spurs and all that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leggins of fancy fringed leather;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He takes pride in his boots and the pistol he shoots,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he’s happy in all kinds of weather;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’s fond of his horse, it’s a broncho, of course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For oh, he can ride like the devil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is old for his years and he always appears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a fellow who’s lived on the level;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He can sing, he can cook, yet his eyes have the look</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a man that to fear is a stranger;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yes, his cool, quiet nerve will always subserve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his wild life of duty and danger.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gets little to eat, and he guys tenderfeet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for fashion, oh well! he’s not in it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He can rope a gay steer when he gets on its ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the rate of two-forty a minute;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His saddle’s the best in the wild, woolly West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes it will cost sixty dollars;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, he knows all the tricks when he brands mavericks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But his knowledge is not got from your scholars;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is loyal as steel, but demands a square deal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he hates and despises a coward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet the cowboy, you’ll find, to women is kind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he’ll fight till by death overpowered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence I say unto you⁠—give the cowboy his due</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be kind, my friends, to his folly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he’s generous and brave though he may not behave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like your dudes, who are so melancholy.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Th’ devil’s laid hold on us, tooth an’ branch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ uses us in his biz.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still, we ain’t so bad but we might be wuss,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>If you happened⁠—an’ unbeknown to us⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around, of a Sunday night.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Th’ week-day manners is stowed away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ jokes an’ the card games halts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Dick’s ol’ fiddle begins to play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A toon⁠—an’ it ain’t no waltz.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It digs fer th’ things that are out o’ sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It delves through th’ toughest crust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It grips th’ heart-strings, an’ holds ’em tight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till we’ve got ter sing⁠—er bust!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With pipin’ treble the kid starts in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ Hell! how that kid kin sing!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yield not to temptation, fer yieldin’ is sin,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He leads, an’ the rafters ring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We shouts it with force an’ vim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Look ever to Jesus, he’ll carry you through,”⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s puttin’ it up to Him!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We ain’t no saints on the ol’ Bar-Z,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But many a time an’ oft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When ol’ fiddle’s a-pleadin’, “Abide with me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our hearts gets kinder soft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ we makes some promises there an’ then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which we keeps⁠—till we goes to bed⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s the most could be ast o’ a passel o’ men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What ain’t no saints, as I said.</span>

				<p>
					<span>I’ve beat my way wherever any winds have blown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve bummed along from Portland down to San Antone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Sandy Hook to Frisco, over gulch and hill⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For once you git the habit, why, you can’t keep still.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I settled down quite frequent, and I says, says I,</span>

					<span>“I’ll never wander further till I come to die.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the wind it sorter chuckles, “Why, o’ course you will.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ sure enough I does it ’cause I can’t keep still.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’ve seen a lot o’ places where I’d like to stay,</span>

					<span>I was never meant for settin’ on my own door sill,</span>

					<span>I’ve been in rich men’s houses an’ I’ve been in jail,</span>

					<span>I’m a human bird of passage and the song I trill</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sun is sorter coaxin’ an’ the road is clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ the wind is singin’ ballads that I got to hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It ain’t no use to argue when you feel the thrill;</span>

					<span>For, once you git the habit, why, you can’t keep still.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">A Ranger</h3>
				<p>
					<span>He never made parade of tooth or claw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was plain as us that nursed the bawlin’ herds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he had a rather meanin’-lookin’ jaw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was shy of exercisin’ it with words.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a circus-ridin’ preacher of the law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All his preachin’ was the sort that hit the nail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was just a common ranger, just a ridin’ pilgrim stranger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he labored with the sinners of the trail.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Once a Yaqui knifed a woman, jealous mad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then hit southward with the old, old killer’s plan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nobody missed the woman very bad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While they’d just a little rather missed the man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the ranger crossed his trail and sniffed it glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then loped away to bring him back again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he stood for peace and order on the lonely, sunny border</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his business was to hunt for sinful men!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So the trail it led him southward all the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the shinin’ country of the thorn and snake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the heat had drove the lizards from their play</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the shade of rock and bush and yucca stake.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the mountains heaved and rippled far away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the desert broiled as on the devil’s prong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he didn’t mind the devil if his head kept clear and level</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the hoofs beat out their clear and steady song.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Came the yellow west, and on a far off rise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Something black crawled up and dropped beyond the rim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he reached his rifle out and rubbed his eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he cussed the southern hills for growin’ dim.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down a hazy ’royo came the coyote cries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like they laughed at him because he’d lost his mark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the smile that brands a fighter pulled his mouth a little tighter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he set his spurs and rode on through the dark.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Came the moonlight on a trail that wriggled higher</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the mountains that look into Mexico,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the shadows strung his nerves like banjo wire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the miles and minutes dragged unearthly slow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then a black mesquite spit out a thread of fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the canyon walls flung thunder back again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he caught himself and fumbled at his rifle while he grumbled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That his bridle arm had weight enough for ten.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Though his rifle pointed wavy-like and slack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he grabbed for leather at his hawse’s shy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet he sent a soft-nosed exhortation back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That convinced the sinner⁠—just above the eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So the sinner sprawled among the shadows black</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the ranger drifted north beneath the moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wabblin’ crazy in his saddle, workin’ hard to stay a-straddle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the hoofs beat out a slow and sorry tune.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When the sheriff got up early out of bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he stared and vowed his soul a total loss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he saw the droopy thing all blotched with red</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That came ridin’ in aboard a tremblin’ hawse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But “I got ’im” was the most the ranger said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you couldn’t hire him, now, to tell the tale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was just a quiet ranger, just a ridin’ pilgrim stranger</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he labored with the sinners of the trail.</span>

					<span>I went into the grog-shop, Tom, and stood beside the bar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drank a glass of lemonade and smoked a bad seegar.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same old kegs and jugs was thar, the same we used to know</span>

					<span>When we was on the round-up, Tom, some twenty years ago.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The bar-tender is not the same. The one who used to sell</span>

					<span>Corroded tangle-foot to us, is rotting now in hell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one has got a plate-glass front, he combs his hair quite low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He looks just like the one we knew some twenty years ago.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Old soak came up and asked for booze and had the same old grin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While others burned their living forms and wet their coats with gin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outside the doorway women stood, their faces seamed with woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wept just like they used to weep some twenty years ago.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I asked about our old-time friends, those cheery, sporty men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some was in the poor-house, Tom, and some was in the pen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You know the one you liked the best?⁠—the hang-man laid him low⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh, few are left that used to booze some twenty years ago.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You recollect our favorite, whom pride claimed for her own⁠—</span>

					<span>He used to say that he could booze or leave the stuff alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He perished for the James Fitz James, out in the rain and snow⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yes, few survive who used to booze some twenty years ago.</span>

					<span>I visited the old church yard and there I saw the graves</span>

					<span>’Twas the lean coyote told me, baring his slavish soul,</span>

					<span class="i1">As I counted the ribs of my dead cayuse and cursed at the desert sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tale of the Upland Rider’s fate while I dug in the water hole</span>

					<span class="i1">For a drop, a taste of the bitter seep; but the water hole was dry!</span>

				<p>
					<span>“He came,” said the lean coyote, “and he cursed as his pony fell;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he counted his pony’s ribs aloud; yea, even as you have done.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He raved as he ripped at the clay-red sand like an imp from the pit of hell,</span>

					<span class="i1">Shriveled with thirst for a thousand years and craving a drop⁠—just one.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“His name?” I asked, and he told me, yawning to hide a grin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“His name is writ on the prison roll and many a place beside;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Last, he scribbled it on the sand with a finger seared and thin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I watched his face as he spelled it out⁠—laughed as I laughed, and died.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And thus,” said the lean coyote, “his need is the hungry’s feast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mine.” I fumbled and pulled my gun⁠—emptied it wild and fast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one of the crazy shots went home and silenced the waiting beast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There lay the shape of the Liar, dead! ’Twas I that should laugh the last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Laugh? Nay, now I would write my name as the Upland Rider wrote;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Write? What need, for before my eyes in a wide and wavering line</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw the trace of a written word and letter by letter float</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into a mist as the world grew dark; and I knew that the name was mine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dreams and visions within the dream; turmoil and fire and pain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hands that proffered a brimming cup⁠—empty, ere I could take;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the burst of a thunder-head⁠—rain! It was rude, fierce rain!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blindly down to the hole I crept, shivering, drenched, awake!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dawn⁠—and the edge of the red-rimmed sun scattering golden flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As stumbling down to the water hole came the horse that I thought was dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But never a sign of the other beast nor a trace of a rider’s name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just a rain-washed track and an empty gun⁠—and the old home trail ahead.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>A moment or two will be only good manners,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The judicious acts of this court will be white.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Long Point, Arkansas, the thirteenth of August,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My dearest son James, somewhere out in the West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For long, weary months I’ve been waiting for tidings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since your last loving letter came eastward to bless.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ‘God bless you, my son, for thus sending that money,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remembering your mother when sorely in need.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May the angels from heaven now guard you from danger</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And happiness follow your generous deed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I long so to see you come into the doorway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As you used to, of old, when weary, to rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May the days be but few when again I can greet you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My comfort and staff, is your mother’s request.’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Say, pard, here’s your letter. I’m not good at writin’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think you’d do better to answer them lines;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ fer fear I might want it I’ll take off that lasso,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ the hoss you kin leave when you git to the pines.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ Jim, when yer see yer old mother jist tell her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a wee bit o’ writin’ kinder hastened the day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When her boy could come eastward to stay with her always.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come boys, up and mount and to Denver away.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O’er the prairies the sun tipped the trees with its splendor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dew on the grass flashed the diamonds so bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the tenderest memories came like a blessing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the days of sweet childhood on pinions of light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not a word more was spoken as they parted that morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet the trail of a tear marked each cheek as they turned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For higher than law is the love of a mother⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It reversed the decision⁠—the court was adjourned.</span>

					<span>’Mid lava rock and glaring sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Neath the desert’s brassy skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bound in the silent chains of death</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A border bandit lies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The poppy waves her golden glow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above the lowly mound;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cactus stands with lances drawn⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A martial guard around.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His dreams are free from guile or greed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or foray’s wild alarms.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No fears creep in to break his rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the desert’s scorching arms.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sleeps in peace beside the trail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the twilight shadows play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though they watch each night for his return</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand miles away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From the mesquite groves a night bird calls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the western skies grow red;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sand storm sings his deadly song</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above the sleeper’s head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His steed has wandered to the hills</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And helpless are his hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet peons curse his memory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the shifting sands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The desert cricket tunes his pipes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the half-grown moon shines dim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sage thrush trills her evening song⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what are they to him?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A rude-built cross beside the trail</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Casts its long-drawn, ghastly shadow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the sleeper’s breast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A lone coyote comes by night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sits beside his bed,</span>

					<span>Sobbing the midnight hours away</span>

					<span>With gaunt, up-lifted head.</span>

					<span>The lizard trails his aimless way</span>

					<span>See, stretching yonder o’er that low divide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which parts the falling rain⁠—the eastern slope</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sends down its waters to the southern sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through Double Mountain’s winding length of stream;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The western side spreads out into a plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which sinks away o’er tawny, rolling leagues</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At last into the rushing Rio Grande⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See, faintly showing on that distant ridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The deep-cut pathways through the shelving crest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sage-matted now and rimmed with chaparral,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dim reminders of the olden times,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The life of stir, of blood, of Indian raid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hunt of buffalo and antelope;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The camp, the wagon train, the sea of steers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cowboy’s lonely vigil through the night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stampede and the wild ride through the storm;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The call of California’s golden flood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The impulse of the Saxon’s “Westward Ho”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which set our fathers’ faces from the east,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To spread resistless o’er the barren wastes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To people all the regions ’neath the sun⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those vikings of the old Mackenzie Trail.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It winds⁠—this old forgotten cattle trail⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through valleys still and silent even now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save when the yellow-breasted desert lark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cries shrill and lonely from a dead mesquite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In quivering notes set in a minor key;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The endless round of sunny days, of starry nights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The desert’s blank immutability.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The coyote’s howl is heard at dark from some</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Low-lying hill; companioned by the loafer wolf</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They yelp in concert to the far off stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or gnaw the bleachèd bones in savage rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lie unburied by the grass-grown paths.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The prairie dogs play sentinel by day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And backward slips the badger to his den;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whir, the fatal strike of rattlesnake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A staring buzzard floating in the blue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, now and then, the curlew’s eerie call⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lost, always lost, and seeking evermore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All else is mute and dormant; vacantly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sun looks down, the days run idly on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The breezes whirl the dust, which eddying falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smothering the records of the westward caravans,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where silent heaps of wreck and nameless graves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make milestones for the old Mackenzie Trail.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Across the Brazos, Colorado, through</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Concho’s broad, fair valley, sweeping on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Abilene it climbs upon the plains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Llano Estacado (beyond lie wastes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of alkali and hunger gaunt and death)⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here is lost in shifting rifts of sand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anon it lingers by a hidden spring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bubbles joy into the wilderness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its pathway trenched that distant mountain side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now grown to gulches through torrential rain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>De Vaca gathered piñons by the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long ere the furrows grew on yonder hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cut by the creaking prairie-schooner wheels;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>La Salle, the gentle Frenchman, crossed this course,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went to death and to a nameless grave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ages and for ages through the past</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comanches and Apaches from the north</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came sweeping southward, searching for the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And charged in mimic combat on the sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The scions of Montezuma’s low-browed race</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps have seen that knotted, thorn-clad tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or sucked the cactus apples growing there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All these have passed, and passed the immigrants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who bore the westward fever in their brain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Norseman tang for roving in their veins;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who loved the plains as sailors love the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Braved danger, death, and found a resting place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While traveling on the old Mackenzie Trail.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Brave old Mackenzie long has laid him down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To rest beyond the trail that bears his name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A granite mountain makes his monument;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The northers, moaning o’er the low divide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go gently past his long deserted camps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more his rangers guard the wild frontier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more he leads them in the border fight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more the mavericks, winding stream of horns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Kansas bound; the dust, the cowboy songs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cries, the pistol’s sharp report⁠—the free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wild days in Texas by the Rio Grande.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some men say when dusky night shuts down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark, cloudy nights without a kindly star,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One sees dim horsemen skimming o’er the plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hard by Mackenzie’s trail; and keener ears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have heard from deep within the bordering hills</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tramp of ghostly hoofs, faint cattle lows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rumble of a moving wagon train,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes far echoes of a frontier song;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then sounds grow fainter, shadows troop away⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On westward, westward, as they in olden time</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went rangeing o’er the old Mackenzie Trail.</span>

					<span>An awful change has hit the range</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since that old poet’s day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For you’re just silly, on’ry brutes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I look like distress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my pipe ain’t the kind that toots</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there’s no “shepherdess.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet ’way down home in Kansas State,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bliss Township, Section Five,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s one that’s promised me to wait,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sweetest girl alive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s why I salt my wages down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mend my clothes with strings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While others blow their pay in town</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For booze and other things.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A‑a! ma‑a! ba‑a! eh‑eh‑eh!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Minnie, don’t be sad;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Next year we’ll lease that splendid piece</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That corners on your dad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ll drive to “literary,” dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The way we used to do</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turn my lonely workin’ here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To happiness for you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Suppose, down near that rattlers’ den,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While I sit here and dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d spy a bunch of ugly men</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hear a woman scream.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suppose I’d let my rifle shout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drop the men in rows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the woman should turn out⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Minnie!⁠—just suppose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A‑a! ma‑a! ba‑a! eh‑eh‑eh!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tune would then be gay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is, I mind, a parson kind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just forty miles away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why, Eden would come back again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sage and sheep corrals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I could swing a singin’ pen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To write her “pastorals.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I pack a rifle on my arm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And jump at flies that buzz;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s nothin’ here to do me harm;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I sometimes wish there was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If through that brush above the pool</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A red should creep⁠—and creep⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wah! cut down on ’im!⁠—Stop, you fool!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That’s nothin’ but a sheep.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A‑a! ma‑a! ba‑a!⁠—Hell!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oh, sky and plain and bluff!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless my mail comes up the trail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’m locoed, sure enough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What’s that?⁠—a dust-whiff near the butte</span>

					<span>Yes, o’ cose it’s interestin’ to a feller from the range,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mighty queerish, too, I tell you⁠—sich a racket fer a change;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From a life among the cattle, from a wool shirt and the chaps</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the biled shirt o’ the city and the other tony traps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never seed sich herds o’ people throwed together, every brand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’ humanity, I reckon, in this big mountain land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rounded up right here in Denver, runnin’ on new sort o’ feed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Actin’ restless an’ oneasy, like they threatened to stampede.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Mighty curious to a rider comin’ from the range, he feels</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What you’d call a lost sensation from sombrero clar to heels;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a critter stray that drifted in a windstorm from its range</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To another run o’ grazin’ where the brands it sees are strange.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I see a city herder, a policeman, don’t you know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sort o’ think he’s got men spotted an’ is ’bout to make a throw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fer to catch me an’ corral me fer a stray till he can talk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the wire an’ tell the owner fer to come an’ get his stock.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, it’s mighty strange an’ funny fer a cowboy, as you say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fer to hit a camp like this one, so unanimously gay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I want to tell you, pardner, that a rider sich as me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Isn’t built fer feedin’ on sich crazy jamboree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every bone I got’s a-achin’, an’ my feet as sore as if</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had hit a bed o’ cactus, an’ my hinges is as stiff</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From a-hittin’ these hot pavements as a feller’s jints kin git⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Taint like holdin’ down a broncho on the range, a little bit.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’m hankerin’, I tell you, fer to hit the trail an’ run</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a crazy, locoed yearlin’ from this big cloud-burst o’ fun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Back toward the cattle ranches, where a feller’s breath comes free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ he wears the clothes that fits him, ’stead o’ this slick toggery.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where his home is in the saddle, an’ the heavens is his roof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ his ever’day companions wears the hide an’ cloven hoof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the beller of the cattle is the only sound he hears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ he never thinks o’ nothin’ but his grub an’ hoss an’ steers.</span>

					<span>I rode across a valley range</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hadn’t seen for years.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The trail was all so spoilt and strange</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It nearly fetched the tears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had to let ten fences down⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The fussy lanes ran wrong)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each new line would make me frown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hum a mournin’ song.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">Oh, it’s squeak! squeak! squeak!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hear ’em stretchin’ of the wire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The nester brand is on the land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I reckon I’ll retire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While progress toots her brassy horn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And makes her motor buzz,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I thank the Lord I wasn’t born</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No later than I wuz!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twas good to live when all the sod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without no fence nor fuss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Belonged in partnership to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Government and us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With skyline bounds from east to west</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And room to go and come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I loved my fellowman the best</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he was scattered some.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">Oh, it’s squeak! squeak! squeak!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Close and closer cramps the wire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There’s hardly play to back away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And call a man a liar.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their house has locks on every door;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>It’s only lovely, free and big</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And isn’t worth a cent.</span>

					<span>I pray that them who come to spoil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May wait till I am dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before they foul that blessed soil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fence and cabbage head.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">Yet it’s squeak! squeak! squeak!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far and farther crawls the wire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To crowd and pinch another inch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is all their heart’s desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The world is over-stocked with men,</span>

					<span>When my old soul hunts range and rest</span>

					<span>Beyond the last divide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just plant me in some stretch of West</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s sunny, lone and wide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let cattle rub my tombstone down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And coyotes mourn their kin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let hawses paw and tramp the moun’⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But don’t you fence it in!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">Oh, it’s squeak! squeak! squeak!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they pen the land with wire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They figure fence and copper cents</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his old land of Uz,</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Gila Monster Route</h3>
				<p>
					<span>The lingering sunset across the plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kissed the rear-end door of an east-bound train,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shone on a passing track close by</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where a ding-bat sat on a rotting tie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was ditched by a shock and a cruel fate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The con high-balled, and the manifest freight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pulled out on the stem behind the mail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she hit the ball on a sanded rail.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As she pulled away in the falling light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He could see the gleam of her red tail-light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the moon arose and the stars came out⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was ditched on the Gila Monster Route.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nothing in sight but sand and space;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No chance for a gink to feed his face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not even a shack to beg for a lump,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or a hen-house to frisk for a single gump.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He gazed far out on the solitude;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He drooped his head and began to brood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thought of the time he lost his mate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a hostile burg on the Nickle Plate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They had mooched the stem and threw their feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And speared four-bits on which to eat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But deprived themselves of daily bread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shafted their coin for “dago red.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Down by the track in the jungle’s glade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the cool green grass, in the tules’ shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shed their coats and ditched their shoes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tanked up full of that colored booze.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then they took a flop with their skins plumb full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they did not hear the harnessed bull,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he shook them out of their boozy nap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a husky voice and a loaded sap.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They were charged with “vag,” for they had no kale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the judge said, “Sixty days in jail.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the John had a bindle⁠—a worker’s plea⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So they gave him a floater and set him free.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They had turned him up, but ditched his mate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he grabbed the guts of an east-bound freight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He flung his form on a rusty rod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he heard the shack say, “Hit the sod!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The John piled off, he was in the ditch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With two switch lamps and a rusty switch⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A poor, old, seedy, half-starved bo</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On a hostile pike, without a show.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From away off somewhere in the dark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came the sharp, short notes of a coyote’s bark.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bo looked round and quickly rose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shook the dust from his threadbare clothes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Off in the west through the moonlit night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw the gleam of a big head-light⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An east-bound stock train hummed the rail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was due at the switch to clear the mail.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As she drew up close, the head-end shack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Threw the switch to the passenger track,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stock rolled in and off the main,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the line was clear for the west-bound train.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When she hove in sight far up the track,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was workin’ steam, with her brake shoes slack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She hollered once at the whistle post,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then she flitted by like a frightened ghost.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He could hear the roar of the big six-wheel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her driver’s pound on the polished steel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the screech of her flanges on the rail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As she beat it west o’er the desert trail.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The John got busy and took the risk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He climbed aboard and began to frisk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He reached up high and began to feel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the end-door pin⁠—then he cracked the seal.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twas a double-decked stock-car, filled with sheep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old John crawled in and went to sleep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She whistled twice and high-balled out⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were off, down the Gila Monster Route.</span>

					<span>The coyotes’ cry and the wind-swept sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the waving billows of green!</span>

					<span>And oh, for a night in the open</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where no sound discordant mars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the marvelous glow, when the sun is low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the silence under the stars!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ho, wind from the western prairies!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ho, voice from a far domain!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I feel in your breath what I’ll feel till death,</span>

					<span>The call of the plains again!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The call of the Spirit of Freedom</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And prairie dogs would sauce him, as at their doors they sat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rattler hissed its warning when near its haunts he trod</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some Texas steer pursuing o’er the pathless waste of sod.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lasso, quirt, and ’colter the cowboy knew his skill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They pass with him to history and naught their place can fill;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he, bold broncho rider, ne’er conned a lesson page⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But cattle, cattle, cattle, and sun and sand and sage.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And oh! the long night watches, with terror in the skies!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When lightning played and mocked him till blinded were his eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When raged the storm around him, and fear was in his heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest panic-stricken leaders might make the whole herd start.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That meant a death for many, perhaps a wild stampede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When none could stem the fury of the cattle in the lead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, then life seemed so little and death so very near⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With cattle, cattle, cattle, and darkness everywhere.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then quaff with me a bumper of water, clear and pure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the memory of the cowboy whose fame must e’er endure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the Llano Estacado to Dakota’s distant sands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where were herded countless thousands in the days of fenceless lands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us rear for him an altar in the Temple of the Brave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weave of Texas grasses a garland for his grave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And offer him a guerdon for the work that he has done</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With cattle, cattle, cattle, and sage and sand and sun.</span>

					<span>We’re the children of the open and we hate the haunts o’ men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But we had to come to town to get the mail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we’re ridin’ home at daybreak⁠—’cause the air is cooler then⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All ’cept one of us that stopped behind in jail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shorty’s nose won’t bear paradin’, Bill’s off eye is darkly fadin’,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All our toilets show a touch of disarray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For we found that City life is a constant round of strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we aint the breed for shyin’ from a fray.</span>
				</p>
				<p class="vocals">
					<span>Chant your warhoops, pardners, dear, while the east turns pale with fear</span>
					<br/>

					<span>For we’re wicked to the marrer; we’re a midnight dream of terror</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we’re ridin’ up the rocky trail from town!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We acquired our hasty temper from our friend, the centipede.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the rattlesnake we learnt to guard our rights.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We have gathered fightin’ pointers from the famous bronco steed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the bobcat teached us reppertee that bites.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So when some high-collared herrin’ jeered the garb that I was wearin’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twasn’t long till we had got where talkin’ ends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he et his ill-bred chat, with a sauce of derby hat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While my merry pardners entertained his friends.</span>
				</p>
				<p class="vocals">
					<span>Sing ’er out, my buckeroos! Let the desert hear the news.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Since old Jacob skinned his dad-in-law of six years’ crop of calves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then hit the trail for Canaan in the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There has been a taste for battle ’mong the men that follow cattle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a love of doin’ things that’s wild and strange.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the warmth of Laban’s words when he missed his speckled herds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still is useful in the language of the range.</span>

				<p class="vocals">
					<span>Sing ’er out, my bold coyotes! leather fists and leather throats,</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Disappointed Tenderfoot</h3>
				<p>
					<span>He reached the West in a palace car where the writers tell us the cowboys are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the redskin bold and the centipede and the rattlesnake and the loco weed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He looked around for the Buckskin Joes and the things he’d seen in the Wild West shows⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cowgirls gay and the bronchos wild and the painted face of the Injun child.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He listened close for the fierce war-whoop, and his pent-up spirits began to droop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he wondered then if the hills and nooks held none of the sights of the story books.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He’d hoped he would see the marshal pot some bold bad man with a pistol shot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And entered a low saloon by chance, where the tenderfoot is supposed to dance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the cowboy shoots at his bootheels there and the smoke of powder begrims the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all was quiet as if he’d strayed to that silent spot where the dead are laid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not even a faro game was seen, and none flaunted the long, long green.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas a blow for him who had come in quest of a touch of the real wild woolly West.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He vainly sought for a bad cayuse and the swirl and swish of the flying noose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the cowboy’s yell as he roped a steer, but nothing of this fell on his ear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not even a wide-brimmed hat he spied, but derbies flourished on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the spurs and the “chaps” and the flannel shirts, the high-heeled boots and the guns and the quirts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cowboy saddles and silver bits and fancy bridles and swell outfits</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’d read about in the novels grim, were not on hand for the likes of him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He peered about for a stagecoach old, and a miner-man with a bag of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a burro train with its pack-loads which he’d read they tie with the diamond hitch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rattler’s whir and the coyote’s wail ne’er sounded out as he hit the trail;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And no one knew of a branding bee or a steer round-up that he longed to see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the oldest settler named Six-Gun Sim rolled a cigarette and remarked to him:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The West hez gone to the East, my son, and it’s only in tents sich things is done.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>When I ride into the mountains on my little broncho bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whar my ears are never pelted with the bawlin’ o’ the herd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ a sort o’ dreamy quiet hangs upon the western air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ thar ain’t no animation to be noticed anywhere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I sort o’ feel oneasy, git a notion in my head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’m the only livin’ mortal⁠—everybody else is dead⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ I feel a queer sensation, rather skeery like, an’ odd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When thar ain’t nobody near me, ’ceptin’ God.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Every rabbit that I startle from its shaded restin’ place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seems a furry shaft o’ silence shootin’ into noiseless space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ a rattlesnake a crawlin’ through the rocks so old an’ gray</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helps along the ghostly feelin’ in a rather startlin’ way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every breeze that dares to whisper does it with a bated breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every bush stands grim an’ silent in a sort o’ livin’ death⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell you what, a feller’s feelin’s give him many an icy prod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When thar ain’t nobody near him, ’ceptin’ God.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Somehow allus git to thinkin’ o’ the error o’ my ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ my memory goes wingin’ back to childhood’s happy days,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When a mother, now a restin’ in the grave so dark an’ deep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Used to listen while I’d whisper, “Now I lay me down to sleep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then a sort o’ guilty feelin’ gits a surgin’ in my breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ I wonder how I’ll stack up at the final judgment test,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conscience allus welts it to me with a mighty cuttin’ rod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When thar ain’t nobody near me, ’ceptin’ God.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Take the very meanest sinner that the nation ever saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One that don’t respect religion more’n he respects the law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One that never does an action that’s commendable or good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ immerse him fur a season out in Nature’s solitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An’ the cog-wheels o’ his conscience’ll be rattled out o’ gear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More’n if he ’tended preachin’ every Sunday in the year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fur his sins ’ill come a ridin’ through his cranium rough shod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When thar ain’t nobody near him, ’ceptin’ God.</span>
